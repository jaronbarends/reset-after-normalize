#reset-after-normalize.css

css file to be used after including normalize.css. normalize.css has a lot of good stuff in it, but does too much styling as far as I'm concerned. This reset regorously resets all margins and paddings.

##Usage

- first include normalize.css in your code
- after that, include reset-after-normalize.css in your code.
